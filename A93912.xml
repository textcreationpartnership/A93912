         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:118993:3"/> Horizon will ſhew upon the limbe the quantity of any angle taken in the field, as well as the <hi>Theodolite, Plain Table, Circumferentor,</hi> or <hi>Peractor,</hi> or any other ſuch like Inſtrument; ſo that hereby it doth appear to be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Companion for moſt ſorts of men; but eſpecially for Navigators or Travellers. For hereby they may finde Altitude and Declination of Sun or Stars, and thereby the latitude of the place where they are; where alſo they may finde the Amplitude and Azimuth, and ſuch like concluſions; whereby they may finde the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of their Compaſſe; ſo likewiſe may they readily finde the time of Sun-riſing and ſetting, with the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ending of twilight; the hour of the day by the Sun, and the hour of the Night by the fixed Stars and Planets; with the time of their Riſing, Southing and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and that very eaſily and ſpeedily: with the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch Nautical Propoſitions, as are of moſt frequent uſe amongſt them.</p>
            <p>The whole Treatiſe conſiſteth of three Books; the firſt whereof, ſheweth the conſtruction and general uſe of the Inſtrument; and how thereby to reſolve all ſuch Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions as may be applied to right lines only; as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning of lines and ſuperficies, the meaſuring of all manner of Land, Board, Glaſs, Timbet, Stone and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>The Second, ſheweth the moſt plentiful, eaſie, and ſpeedie Reſolution of the whole Doctrine Trigonome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical, both plain and Spherical, and that two ſeveral wayes, with ſurpaſſing facility.</p>
            <p>The Third, ſheweth how to reſolve all ſuch Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Aſtronomical, as are of moſt frequent uſe in the Art of Navigation and Dialling, with the reſolution of all
<pb facs="tcp:118993:3"/> ſuch Nautical Propoſitions, as are of ordinary uſe amongſt Seamen, concerning Longitude, Latitude, Rumbe, and Diſtance.</p>
            <p>All which I very well know, may more exactly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Canon of Sines, Tangents, and Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmes, yet nothing ſo ſpeedily as on the Inſtrument: but for obſervation an Inſtrument muſt be had, wherewith (if thou likeſt it) thou art here fitted, both for obſervation and operation.</p>
            <p>Thus deſiring thee to accept of this Inſtrument from me, as I here freely preſent it to thee, which I wiſh even ſo to further thee, as I know it ſufficient for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of much more then I have ſpoken of it. <hi>Farewel.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Quadrat or Square Geometricall is a figure of four equall ſides, whoſe angles are all right angles, within the limits of which figure, we intend to deſcribe an Univerſall Inſtrument, for the ſpeedy performance of moſt Mathematicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſions; and that generally for all Latitudes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore, prepare a piece of Box or Braſſe, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118993:9"/> after you have made it very ſmooth and plain, cut it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly four ſquare, with four equall ſides, and angles all right. Your Wood or Braſſe being thus prepared, draw thereupon four right lines, equally diſtant or parallel to the edges, all of them cutting one the other at right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles: let the parallel diſtance of theſe lines from the edges be ſo much as that you may place the figures to the diviſions limb, like as you may perceive by the figure. This being done, divide each ſide of the Square into 100 equall parts, or rather 1000, if quantity will give leave, for the larger the Inſtrument is, the more exactly wil the concluſions wrought thereby be performed, but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument not ſo portable. Then from each diviſion of the one ſide, draw parallel lines to the like diviſion on the oppoſite ſide, the like do by the other two ſides; ſo ſhall the whole face of the Inſtrument be filled with parallel lines both wayes, and croſſing each other at right angles, according to the common Sinicall Quadrant, and for the better diſtinction of theſe parallels, you may prick every fifth, ſo may you guide your eye along upon them the better.</p>
               <p>This being done, make choice of one of the angles for a center, as here we have done at A, from which you ſhall number the two next ſides by 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. unto 100, and place figures to them in the margine, as you ſee in the figure.</p>
               <p>Then ſetting one foot of your Compaſſes in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter A, with the other opened to the full length of one of the ſides, draw the Quadrant BC over all the parallels, this Quadrant divide into 90 equall degrees, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divide each degree into as many parts as quantity will give leave, and let them be numbered with 10, 20, 30, &amp;c.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118993:9"/> unto 90, both ways, as there you ſee: and if upon the center A with any convenient diſtance you deſcribe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Quadrant, and divide it into ſix equal parts as in my other Quadrat ſet down, and draw ſlope lines to each 15th. deg. in the Quadrant BC, and number them back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, then theſe ſlope lines may be accounted as hours in the art of dialling, and will be ſufficient to perform the whole Art of Dialling, as I have at large taught in my Book lately publiſhed, called the <hi>Compleat Dialliſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This done, by laying a Ruler upon the center A, and each degree in the Quadrant. BC, you may divide the two oppoſite ſides from the center, each into 45 unequal degrees called Tangents, let theſe be numbered by 10, 20 30, &amp;c. unto 90 degrees, from B at the left hand, to 45 in the oppoſite angle, and ſo on to 90 at C the right hand of the Quadrant, and back again as in the Quadrant, and as you ſee in the figure; draw alſo the diagonal line AD. To this Inſtrument, as to all other of this kinde, in their uſe, is added Sights with a threed, bead, and plummet according to the uſual manner.</p>
               <p>The fore-ſide of this Quadrat is of it ſelfe (being of a portable ſize, and exactly drawn) an abſolute Inſtrument for the ſpeedy reſolution of both kinds of <hi>Trigonometria;</hi> as well ſpherical as plain; as ſhall be made manifeſt in the enſuing Treatiſe, by applying it in ſeveral kindes.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing the backſide of this Univerſal Inſtrument ſtandeth yet blank, we will make uſe thereof in fixing a moveable Planiſphere of Braſſe thereon; on which Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſphere, we may project the Sphere <hi>in plano</hi> with ſtreight lines; and ſo by help of a fixed Horizontal line and fixed Almicanters, we ſhall make this ſide alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118993:10"/> Univerſal to performe moſt Spherical concluſions, and that moſt demonſtratively, and generally for all La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes. The deſcription whereof is after this manner.</p>

            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. II. The deſcription of the back-ſide of the Univerſrl Quadrat.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, upon the back-ſide draw foure ſtraight lines neer to the edges, and parallel thereto, all cutting one the other at right angles as here in the figure you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; upon which lines you ſhall inſert the degrees of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as you ſhall be ſhewed hereafter; within theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees draw four other parallel lines, all cutting one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at right angles, unto which you ſhall draw every tenth degree and ſet his number thereto as here you ſee.</p>
               <p>This being done inſcribe a circle as large as you can within this Square, within which circle, inſcribe two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Concentrical Circles repreſenting the Ecliptique, the dividing whereof ſhall hereafter appear.</p>
               <p>Then upon the ſame Radius with this inwardmoſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, deſcribe another Circle upon ſome thin ſmooth plate, this Circle divide into equal 24 parts or hours, and let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very hour be divided into halfs and quarters, or rather minutes if quantity will give leave and let them be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered towards the right hand as here you ſee.</p>
               <p>That done, draw another Concentrical Circle, upon the margine of the houre Circle, repreſenting the plane of the general Meridian; which divide into four equal parts in 00, 90: 00, 90: and draw the two Diameters 00, 00: 90, 90, croſſing one the other at right Angles in the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118993:10"/> Center of the Planiſphere; ſo ſhall the Diameter 00. 00, Repreſent the Equator; and the Diameter 90. 90. the Circle of the houre of Six; and it is alſo the Axis of the World; wherein 90 at the houre of 18, ſtands for the North pole, and 90 at the houre of 6, ſtands for the South pole; then let each Quarter of the Meridian be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into 90 degrees and numbered from the Equator towards the Poles.</p>
               <p>The Meridian being thus divided, lay a Ruler upon each degree thereof counted from the Equator, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by draw parallel lines to the Equator; theſe parallels ſhall repreſent the Declination of the Sun Moon and Stars; and the Latitude of Towns, Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: and ſhall divide the Axis according to the line of Sines.</p>
               <p>If again we divide the Equator and each of his Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels, in the like ſort as the Axes of the World is divided, and then carefully through each degree draw a line, ſo as it makes no angles; the lines ſo drawn ſhall be Elliptical, and repreſent the houre Circles, the Meridian Circle the houre of 12 at Noon and midnight, and that 15 degrees next unto it drawn through 75 degrees from the Center, the hours of 11 &amp; 1, and that which is drawn through 60 degrees from the Center, the houres of 10 and 2; and ſo of the reſt: let theſe houre Circles be prickt to know them from the other Meridians. Then in the Meridian number 23 deg. 30 minutes, the greateſt Declination of the Sun, from the Equator to ♋, Northward, and to ♑ Southward, and draw the line ♋♑, for the Ecliptique, then numbering 23 degrees 30 minutes from the North-pole North-ward, and from the South pole South-ward, draw the Axes of the Ecliptique, which let be divided
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118993:11"/> in like ſort as the Axis of the World is divided; and through each degree or each fifth degree, draw-lines parallel to the Ecliptique; theſe lines ſo drawn ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Latitude of the planets, and fixed ſtars: and for diſtinction ſake prick every fifth or tenth as before: now if we divide the Ecliptick and his parallels, as the Equator and his parallels are divided; and then carefully draw a line through each 30th. degree, ſo as it makes no Angles; the lines ſo drawn ſhall repreſent the ſignes, the firſt 30 degrees from the Center towards ♋, ſhall ſtand for the ſigne ♈; the 30 degrees next following for ♉, and ſo of the reſt, as you may ſee by the figure.</p>
               <p>The Sphere being thus projected in plain, let us reſort to the back of our Quadrat againe, and draw a line through the Center, cuiting two of the ſides juſt in the middle, ſo ſhall this Diameter make right Angles with the ſides, and repreſent the Horizontal line for any Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then take the juſt length of the Semidiameter of your Plainiſphere and ſet it above and below the Horizon at both ends thereof, in the ſide of the Quadrat as here you ſee; and let this line be divided in like ſort as the Equator and his Axis is divided, and numbered with 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. unto 90 from the Horizon both wayes, theſe are the degrees of Altitude.</p>
               <p>All this being done, let us come to the dividing of the Ecliptique which incompaſſeth the Sphere, which may be done out of a Table of Right Aſcenſions; for place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Sphere upon the Center of the Quadration the back ſide, putting ſome pin through both their Centers, ſo that they may be kept both at a ſtay for ſlipping one beſides the other, then turning the Sphere about, untill the beginning of the houres come to the place where you
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118993:11"/> would have the beginnng of ♈, and there make ſtay of it, and marke the beginning of ♈, at the beginning of the hours: then looking into your Table of Right Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, &amp; ſee what hour ſtandeth againſt the beginning of ♉, and you ſhall finde 1 hour 51 min. therefore number 1 hour 51 min. amongſt the hours back-wards towards the left hand, &amp; there place the beginning of ♉, the like may you doe with the reſt of the Signes, and every degree thereof; remembring, that as you numbered the houres towards the right hand, ſo muſt you number the ſignes towards the left.</p>
               <p>Then laſt of all, prepare a thin narrow ſlip of Braſſe, and rivet it on with the Sphere upon the Quadrat, ſo that the Sphere may turn about at all times when need ſhall require, ſo likewiſe let it be riveted to the Quadrat at both ends, ſo that the upper edge may be juſt with the beginning of the degrees of Altitude; this being thus faſtened, ſhall ſerve for a Horizon generally for all Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.</p>
               <p>This Horizontall line, muſt be divided as the Equator and his Axis; ſo ſhall it naturall ſhew the Amplitude in all Latitudes.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. How to place the fixed Stars in the Sphere, and alſo in the outward Eclipticall Circle, for the ſpeedy find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the houre of the night in all Latitudes.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, you muſt get both the Right Aſcenſion and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, of ſuch Stars as you intend to place in your
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118993:12"/> Inſtrument; the finding whereof ſhall hereafter appeare: theſe being knowne; upon the Stars parallel of Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeek his Right Aſcenſion, amongſt the Meridians or houre Circles; and at the point of interſection, betwixt the ſtars Declination, and Right Aſcenſion, there place the Star.</p>
               <p>As for Example, ſuppoſe I would place <hi>Arcturus</hi> in the Sphere, firſt, I inquire his Right Aſcenſion and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, either by the propoſitions hereafter for that purpoſe, or by this enſuing Table; and ſo finde his Right Aſcenſion to be 13 houres 59 minutes and his Declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be 21 degrees 10 minutes North; therefore upon the 21 parallel and 10 minutes I number 14 houres from ♈ unto ♋, and ſo back again unto 14, and there I place <hi>Arcturus;</hi> the like may be done with any other Star.</p>
               <p>Now what Stars you place in the Sphere, the ſame place in the outward Ecliptique; which may be done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner: enter your Table of Right Aſcenſions, with the Right Aſcenſion of the Star, and ſee what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the Ecliptique anſwers thereto, and place the Star upon the ſame.</p>
               <p>As for example, the Right Aſcenſion of <hi>Arcturus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 14 houres, I enter the Table of right Aſcenſions therewith, and I finde 2 degrees of ♏, anſwer thereunto; therefore <hi>Arcturus</hi> muſt be placed at 2 degrees of ♏ in the outward Ecliptique; the like may be done with any other of the fixed Stars.</p>
               <p>For readineſſe ſake, I have here inſerted a Table of Right Aſcenſions in houres and minutes, whereby the outward Ecliptick may be divided, and the ſtars therein placed: and alſo a Table of the Right Aſcenſion, and Declination, &amp; magnitude, of moſt of the principall fixed Stars, Rectified for this preſent yeare, 1652</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. To ſhew the Generall Uſe of the univerſall Quadrat.</head>
               <p>IN the Uſe of this Quadrat, let us, for diſtinction ſake, call thoſe Parallels which make Right Angles with the line whereon the ſights ſtand, Right Parallels; and the other which Run parallel to the ſame line, Contrary Parallels; the one ſignifying Right ſhadow, the other Contrary ſhadow: the Generall Uſe whereof conſiſts in the ſolution of the Golden Rule, where three lines or numbers being given of a known denomination, a fourth proportionall is to be found, and this ſolution is diverſe in regard of the ſignification of theſe parallel lines, and alſo of the entrance into the worke.</p>
               <p>The ſignification of theſe Parallels is ſometimes ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſometimes compound, ſometimes they ſignifie right lines or numbers only, ſuch as they are ſimple in themſelves, and ſometimes they ſignifie naturall ſines, which is halfe the Chord of the double Arch, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times naturall Tangents, which are perpendiculars at the end of the Diameter: ſometimes the work may be begun with one kinde of ſignification, and ended with another, it may be begun with the lines as they are in themſelves, and ended as they are ſines, it may begin as they are ſines, and end as they are Tangents.</p>
               <p>The ſolution in regard of the entrance into the worke, may be either right or contrary. I call that right entrance, or entrance on the Right Parallels, when the two lines or numbers of the firſt denomination are applied or found
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118993:14"/> in the Right parallels, and the third line or number, and that which is ſought for, on the contrary parallels; and on the contrary, I call that contrary entrance, when the two lines or numbers of the firſt denomination, are appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or found on the parallels of contrary ſhadow, and the third line or number, and that which is to be found out, in the parallels of right ſhadow.</p>
               <p>As for example, let there be given three numbers 50. 60, and 70. unto which I am to finde a fourth proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall. Let the Queſtion be this, if 50 pounds, gain 60 ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings what ſhall 70 pounds gaine? here are numbers of two denominations, one of pounds the other of ſhillings, and the firſt with which I am to enter muſt be that of 50. pounds. If then I would enter my Queſtion upon a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel of right ſhadow, ſee where the right Parallel of my firſt number which is 50, cutteth the contrary parallel of the ſecond which is 60, and upon the point of interſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there lay the threed, the threed lying in this poſition, look along upon the right Parallel of the third number, which is 70, and ſee what contrary parallel cutteth it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly under the threed, for that is the fourth proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all number required, which here is found to be 84, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude, that if 50 pounds gaine 60 ſhillings, 70 pounds will gaine 84 ſhillings; for as 50 is to 60, ſo is 70 to 84: the like will apeare if you enter your worke upon the contrary parallels, for it mattereth not on which kind of Parallels you enter, ſo be it you enter your firſt and third number on the ſame kinde of Parallels, ſo ſhall the third and fourth be of the other kinde. Thus much for the Generall Uſe of this fore-ſide of the univerſall Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drat, which being conſidered and well underſtood, there is nothing hard in that which followeth.</p>

North, and thereby the Suns height at ſix RO 9 deg. 6 min. we have given us in the Triangle <hi>by</hi>O, firſt, the angle <hi>yb</hi>O the complement of the latitude 37 deg. 30 min. and then the ſide O<hi>y</hi> 467 the radius being 1000, this ſide is made up of the ſine of the Suns height at ſix 158, and the ſine of 18 deg. 309, or by adding of OR 158, to R<hi>y</hi> 309, we have O<hi>y</hi> 467 for the ſecond proportional, theſe being

               <p>For if we place the threed upon the interſection of the contrary ſine of 37 deg. 30 min. with the right paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel of 467, it will cut the contrary ſine of 90 deg. at the right ſine of 50 deg. 7 min. which is the baſe <hi>b</hi>O. But ſeeing the Radius of this ſine <hi>b</hi>O, is but the coſine of the declination OH 78 deg. 30 min. therefore I place the threed again at the interſection of the contrary ſine of 78 deg. 30 min. with the right ſine of this 50 degr. 7 min. and it will cut the contrary ſine of 90 deg. at the right ſine of 51 deg. 33 min. and ſuch is the diſtance of time between the houre of ſix and the beginning or ending of twilight, being 3 houres 26 min.</p>
               <p>Now at all times, if you take this diſtance out of ſix houres, your remainder ſhall be the beginning of twilight, and if you adde this diſtance found unto 6 hours, the ſum will be the ending of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Except it be in thoſe latitudes, where the depreſſion of 6 is greater then 18 deg. and then you muſt (in that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and South declination, whoſe depreſſion at ſix is more then 18 deg.) work by the contrary rule.</p>
               <p>And when the Sun hath North declination, if you take the aſcenſional difference out of the diſtance of time betweene the houre of ſix, and the beginning or ending of twilight, you ſhall have the diſtance of time betweene Snn riſing or ſetting, and the beginning or ending of twilight.</p>

               <p>As for example, let the diſtance of time betweene the

               <p>And now being the Sun hath North declination, if I take the difference of aſcenſions 1 houre 1 min. (as it was found by the laſt Chapter,) out of 3 houres 26 min. there will remain 2 houres 25 min. for the quantitie of twilight before or after Sun riſing or ſetting.</p>

               <p>For if we apply the threed to the interſection of the contrary ſine of 37 deg. 30 min. with the right parallel of 279, it will cut the contrary ſine of 90 degrees at the right ſine of about 27¼ degrees, but ſeeing this 27¼ degrees which is O♉, is but upon the parallel of declination GO, therefore I place the threed again at the interſection of this 27¼ with the contrary ſine of 78 deg. 30 min. the complement of declination GO, and it will cut the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſine of 90 deg. at the right ſine of 27 deg. 54 min. and ſo much is ♈X or the angle ♈PX, the houre from ſix, which was required.</p>
               <p>And here note that if the Altitude given be greater then the Altitude at ſix, then is the time found to the ſouthward of ſix; but if it be leſſer, then is it to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:118993:95"/>

               <p>For whereas when the Altitude of the Sun given, and his height in the vertical circle is equal, he is directly in the Eaſt or Weſt points; ſo when his Altitude given is greateſt, then is the Azimth towards the South; and when his altitude given is the leaſt, then is the azimuth towards the North.</p>
               <p>Thus in the Diagram of the 6 Chapter, having by the 13 or 14 Chapter found the height of the Sun in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical circle ♈C 14 deg. 33 min. the ſine whereof 251, I take out of 437 the ſine of 25 deg. 56 min. ♈W, the height of the Sun given, and there remaineth CW 186; by which, and the angles WC♉ the latitude 52 deg. 30 min. and W♉C the complement of the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 37 deg. 30 min. we may finde the ſide W♉ by the 10th. or 25th.

               <p>For if we place the threed to the interſection of the contrary ſine of 37 deg. 30 min. with the right parallel or ſine 186, it will cut the contrary ſine of 52 deg. 30 min. at the right ſine of 14 deg. which is the ſide W♉, but ſeeing the Radius of this 14 deg. is but the coſine of the altitude IW, therefore I place the threed again at the interſection of the contrary ſine of 64 deg. 4 min.

               <p>As for example, in the Latitude of 52 deg. 30 min. the Suns place given being in the beginning of m, we may by the 9 Chapter finde his Amplitude to be 19 degrees 7 minutes the ſine whereof is 327, and let the Suns Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude be 23 degrees 20 minutes; now placing the threed to the interſection of the contrary Sine of 37 deg. 30 min. with the right ſine of 13 deg. 20 min. it will cut the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſine of 52 deg. 30 minutes, at the right parallel of 301; unto which 301, put 327 the ſine of the Amplitude, and the ſum will be 628.</p>

Now the eſtimate time being Sun riſing, (which was that morning at 8 a clock and 1 min. in our latitude of 52 deg. 30 min.) I looked in my Almanack for the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude and latitude of ♀, which I found according to Mr. <hi>Vincent Wings</hi> Ephemeris, to be in 18 deg. ♎, with 2 deg.

               <p>IN ſailing by the compaſſe, the courſe holds ſomtime upon a great circle, ſometime upon a parallel to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator; but moſt commonly upon crooked lines wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards one of the Poles, which lines are well known by the name of Rombs.</p>
               <p>If the courſe hold upon a great circle, it is either North or South, under ſome one of the meridians, or elſe Eaſt or Weſt under the Equator: and in theſe caſes, every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree requires an allowance of 20 leagues or 60 miles, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry 20 leagues making a degree difference in ſailing upon thoſe circles; ſo that here needs no further precept then this, divide your leagues ſailed by 20, and you ſhall have the degrees of diſtance; and contrarily, multiply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of diſtance by 20, ſo ſhall you have the number of leagues ſailed.</p>

               <p>FIrſt, place the threed to the interſection of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſine of 90 deg. with the right ſine of the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the middle latitude; and it ſhall cut the contrary parallel of the difference of longitude, at the right paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel of of the difference of longitude in the common Sea-card: then at the interſection of this laſt right parallel, with the contrary parallel of the difference of latitudes, there place the Bead; which being applied to the ſide of the Quadrat ſhall give you the diſtance upon the Rumb as was required.</p>
               <p>Let two Cities be given, one in the latitude of 50 deg. and the other in the latitude of 54 deg. 10 min. and let the difference of longitude be 4 deg. 31 min. now to finde their diſtance, firſt turn their difference of longitude, and alſo of latitude into leagues, ſo will their difference of longitude be 90⅓ leagues, and their difference of latitude 83⅓ leagues; now if you place the thred to the interſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the contrary ſine of 90 deg. with the right ſine of 37 deg. 55 min. (which is the complement of the middle latitude,) it will cut the contrary parallel of 90⅓ leagues, at the right parallel of 55⅔ leagues, for the difference of longitude in the common Sea-card: now where this right parallel of 55⅔ leagues, cutteth the contrary parallel of 83⅓ leagues there place the bead, which being applied to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:118993:113"/> the ſide of the Quadrat, giveth 100 leagues for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the two Cities which was required.</p>
               <p>And if you minde this laſt poſition of the theed, you ſhall ſee it cut in the Quadrant, 33 deg. 45 min. for the Rumb from the Meridian, which leadeth from the one to the other, which is more then was required.</p>

               <p>SUppoſe being at A, I had ſight of ſome land at B, the Ship going from A towards C; and obſerving the firſt angle of the Ships poſition BAC, I finde it to be 18 deg. 26 min. and when the Ship had made 3⅓ leagues or 10 miles of way from A unto D, I obſerved again, and I found the ſecond angle of the ſhips poſition BDC to be 36 deg. 52 min. now may I finde the third angle ABD to be 18 deg. 26 min. either by ſubſtraction, or by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement unto 180 degrees,

The threed lying in the ſame poſition, doth likewiſe cut the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſine of 18 deg: 26 min: the angle BAC, at the right parallel of 10; and ſuch is the diſtance from the place of the ſecond obſervation at D, unto the land at B, which is equal to the Ships way AD, becauſe the angles at A and B happened to be equal.</p>

               <p>TO performe this concluſion and ſuch like, turn the center of your quadrat towards your eye, and then looking through the ſights therof, til you can ſee the very lower part of the hull of the Ship next the Water, note where the threed cutteth the right parallel of the height
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:118993:114"/> of the platforme above the Water, for there paſſeth by the contrary parallel of the diſtance of the ſhip from the baſe of the platforme, and if you place the bead to that interſection, and then apply it to the ſide of the Quadrat, it ſhall there give you the length of the viſual line run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from your eye to the ſhip. As for example,</p>
               <p>Let B be the top of ſome high platforme by the Sea coaſt, whoſe height is known to be 60 paces or any other meaſure; and let it be required from B, to finde the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a ſhip lying at Road at A: firſt, therefore I turn the Center towards my eye, and looking through the ſights towards the ſhip at A, moving it up and down till I can through the ſights eſpie the very loweſt part of the hull of the ſhip next the Water, I finde the threed to cut the right parallel of 60, at the contrary parallel of 180; and ſo much is AC the diſtance of the ſhip at A, from the baſe of the clift or platforme, lying perpendicularly under the Center of your inſtrument at C: and if to this interſection of the parallel of 60, with the parallel of 180, you place the bead, and then apply it to the ſide of the Quadrat, it ſhall there give you very neere 190, and ſuch is the length of the viſual line, paſſing from your eye at B, to the ſhip at A as was required.</p>
